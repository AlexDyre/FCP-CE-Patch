[h1]Description[/h1]
Patches the Fallout Collaboration Project to work with Combat Extended.

Most items still need balancing.
Even though I've done my best to test everything, there may still be errors, so feel free to let me know if you encounter any.

[b]Notes on 5mm ammunition[/b]
I've added a rough first pass of 5mm ammo included with the patch, it should be noted I have done little balancing on this, and could be a bit OP...

[b]Please report any bugs or errors/wrong stats in the discussions section![/b]

Version: 1.3.0.2

[b]Added support for FCP US Army Equipment Teaser[/b]

[h1]Notes for using the Desert Ranger mod[/h1]
When using the Desert Ranger mod, make sure to load the mods listed bellow, as they are defined in both the standalone packs, and part of the DR mod.
In addition, to avoid creating a new ammo type right now (this all takes a lot of effort...), I'm using the "Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Laser" mod to provide the ammo for the Ranger Laser Rifle.
I will Change this in the future, but for now, make sure Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Laser is loaded, and it's requirements. VWE - Laser has a CE patch built into CE itself.

[h1]GitHub[/h1]
The latest version will always be available on Github.

I will be accepting Pull Requests if anyone is willing to help patch or balance items.

[h1]Future Plans[/h1]
I plan to patch all of the necessary Fallout Collaboration Project Mods.
This can be a relatively slow, and repetitive process, so it may take some time.

Feel free to suggest any packs you would like to see next.
