[h1]Description[/h1]
Patches the Fallout Collaboration Project to work with Combat Extended.

Most items still need balancing.
Even though I've done my best to test everything, there may still be errors, so feel free to let me know if you encounter any.

[b]Please report any bugs or errors/wrong stats in the discussions section![/b]

[b]Version: 1.3.2.0[/b]

[b]Added patches for new T-51 Power Armor (Army and Winterised Variants)[/b]
Fixed: Class name for Rivet City equipment changed, updated to patch new class name
[b]IMPORTANT NOTE FOR PEOPLE USING COMBAT EXTENDED VERSION: 1.3.4.2[/b]

Patches included in CE are currently broken, and are actually being removed in the latest (in development) update.
For you will need to go into the CE folder, and simply delete or otherwise move the "Patches/Fallout Collaboration Project" folder.

[h1]GitHub[/h1]
The latest version will always be available on Github.

I will be accepting Pull Requests if anyone is willing to help patch or balance items.

[h1]Future Plans[/h1]
I plan to patch all of the necessary Fallout Collaboration Project Mods.
This can be a relatively slow, and repetitive process, so it may take some time.

Feel free to suggest any packs you would like to see next.
