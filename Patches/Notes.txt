If using Desert Ranger mod, make sure to load the mods listed bellow, as they are defined in both the standalone packs, and part of the DR mod.
In addition, to avoid creating a new ammo type right now (this all takes a lot of effort...), I'm using the "Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Laser" mod to provide the ammo for the Ranger Laser Rifle.
I will Change this in the future, but for now, make sure Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Laser is loaded, and it's requirements. VWE - Laser has a CE patch built into CE itself.

Mods to load alongside DR: FCP FNV Revolvers, FCP FNV Assault Rifles and LMGs, VWE - Laser
